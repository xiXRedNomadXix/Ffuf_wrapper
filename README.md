# Vhost Enumeration Script
I got tired of remembering the ffuf syntax for vhost fuzzing so just scripted it and got carried away with ASCII art. Looks cool though!

# Installation

Install dependancies:
```bash
sudo apt install ffuf seclists
```
this should install SecLists in the right place but if not, just move them to `/usr/share/wordlists/`
Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiXRedNomadXix/Vhost_Enum.git
```
Now you can either make a bash alias for the script or just symlink it. =) Happy huning!
