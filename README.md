# Vhost Enumeration Script
I got tired of remembering the ffuf syntax so i just scripted it and got carried away with ascii art. Looks cool though

Dependancies:
```bash
sudo apt install ffuf seclists
```
this should install SecLists in the right place but if not just move them to `/usr/share/wordlists/` and you should be good.
